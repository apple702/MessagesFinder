# MessagesFinder

This program can read N messages from M input files. These input messages can contain any characters. Each message can be delimited by the newline (\n) character. 

Once the reading of the input is complete, users can make use of a command line interface which allows them to search for different words existing in the messages. When a word is found in a message, the matching message is displayed and the matching word is displayed in uppercase. 

When the program terminates, a summary containing the number of searches performed along with the number of words matched across ALL input files is displayed.
