Once the reading of the input is complete, create a command line interface for the user which allows them to search for different words existing in the messages. When a word is found in a message, display the matching message. Display any matching words in uppercase. Allow the user to enter -1 to exit the program.

When the program terminates, display a summary containing the number of searches performed along with the number of words matched across ALL input files. You can also include other summary information if you would like.

Please complete this task and send me:
	1. A zipped file that includes source code. Please do NOT include any binaries.
	2. Simple instructions on how we should compile and run your code
	3. A simple explanation on the design of your code
	4. A list of third-party libraries used if there is any

Bonus point:
In the assignment, we assume that the memory is big enough to store the entire message. Describe a solution that does not depend on this assumption on paper.

Thank you again for your interest in InsightFinder. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you,
